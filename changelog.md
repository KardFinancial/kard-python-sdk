* Fixed the URL path structure for activating offers by removing the redundant
* /attributions/ segment from the endpoint. This corrects the API route to properly
* target the offers resource directly under users.
* Key changes:
* Update sync client endpoint from /users/{user_id}/attributions/offers/{offer_id}/activate to /users/{user_id}/offers/{offer_id}/activate
* Update async client endpoint with same path correction
* Align endpoint structure with expected API routing pattern
